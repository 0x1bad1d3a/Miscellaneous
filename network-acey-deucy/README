The server and client are both written in python3 so the command to execute
the servers and client will be:

>python3 server.py -m <min players> -l <lobby timeout> -t <play timeout>
>python3 client.py -s <server> -p <port> -n <name> -[a or m]

If no arguments are provided the default arguments will be used.

Both the server and the client implements the curses CLI library, type !help
